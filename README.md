# TreeSkills

Test
There is an object of a tree structure with an arbitrary nesting: https://goo.gl/hd9xME. You need to write code that takes this object to the input and nicely renders it in HTML with the nesting preserved. When you click on an arbitrary element from a tree in HTML, its subtree should be hidden and expanded.
Please do not use ready-made CSS libraries.
